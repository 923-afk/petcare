# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Error - Solution

**The bundled code error you're seeing indicates Vercel is trying to run the full Express server, which doesn't work well with Vercel's serverless architecture.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Vercel error shows:
```javascript
var __defProp = Object.defineProperty;
var __getOwnPropNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames;
// ... bundled code ...
```

This happens because:
- Vercel expects **serverless functions**, not full Express servers
- Your app uses a **traditional Express server** with HTTP server
- The bundling process creates issues with module imports

---

## ✅ Solution: Use Railway Instead!

**Railway is PERFECT for your full-stack Express app!**

### **Why Railway?**
- ✅ Works with Express servers out of the box
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Deploys in 2 minutes
- ✅ Free tier available ($5 credit/month)
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Custom domains
