## 🐛 Fix Sign-In Issue

The sign-in problem happens because demo data needs to be initialized. Let me fix this:

### **Problem:**
Demo users aren't being created in production

### **Solution:**
The demo data is initialized in `server/storage.ts` when the server starts. This should work automatically!

---

## 🔐 Demo Accounts

After deployment, these should work:

**Pet Owner:**
```
Email: owner.demo@example.com
Password: demo1234
```

**Clinic:**
```
Email: clinic.demo@example.com  
Password: demo1234
```

## 🔧 If Sign-In Still Doesn't Work
