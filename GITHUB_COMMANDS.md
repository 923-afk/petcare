2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
6. When git asks for password, paste the token

### **Option B: SSH Key**

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add it to GitHub:
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
# Click "New SSH key"
# Paste your public key

# Use SSH URL instead:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/vetcepi.git
git push -u origin main
```
