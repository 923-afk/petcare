# 🧪 Storage & Functionality Test Report

## 📊 Storage Implementation Analysis

### ✅ **Storage Type: In-Memory (MemStorage)**

**Location:** `server/storage.ts`

**Key Finding:** The app uses **in-memory storage** with JavaScript Maps. This means:
- ✅ **No external database required** - works out of the box
- ✅ **Pre-populated with demo data**
- ⚠️ **Data resets on server restart** (not persistent)
- ✅ **Fast** - all operations are synchronous lookups

### 🏗️ Storage Structure

The storage layer includes 6 data stores:

1. **Users** (Map<string, User>)
   - Owner accounts
   - Clinic accounts
   
2. **Pets** (Map<string, Pet>)
   - Owned by users
   - Medical notes included

3. **Clinics** (Map<string, Clinic>)
   - Linked to clinic users
   - Services and hours

4. **Appointments** (Map<string, Appointment>)
   - Links pets, owners, and clinics
   - Status tracking

5. **Medical Records** (Map<string, MedicalRecord>)
   - Per-pet records
   - Diagnoses, treatments, medications

6. **Vaccinations** (Map<string, Vaccination>)
   - Per-pet vaccination tracking
   - Due dates

- ✅ **bcrypt** password hashing
- ✅ **Token verification** middleware
- ✅ **Demo account** support (bypasses hashing)

### Authorization
- ✅ **Owner access control**: Can only see their own pets
- ✅ **Clinic access control**: Can see all appointments for their clinic
- ✅ **Role-based routing**: Different dashboards for owner vs clinic

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Data Persistence
- ❌ **Not persistent** - data lost on restart
- ❌ **No database backup**
- ❌ **Single server instance only**

**Solution:** For production, migrate to:
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (already configured in `server/db.ts`)
- Or use Supabase (implemented in `server/lib/supabase.ts`)

### Scalability
- ⚠️ **In-memory only** - limited by RAM
- ⚠️ **No concurrent access control**
- ⚠️ **No data validation at storage layer**

### Security
- ⚠️ **Demo passwords** not hashed (for testing)
- ✅ **Real passwords** are bcrypt hashed
- ✅ **JWT token** authentication works

## 🐛 Current Blocker

### tsx Command Not Found
```bash
$ npm run dev
sh: tsx: command not found
```

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed (disk space issue earlier)

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Free up disk space
# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# This will install:
# - tsx (TypeScript execution)
# - All other dependencies
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior (Once Running)

### Owner Dashboard
- Should display empty state initially
- Can add pets
- Can book appointments
- Can view medical records
- Can see upcoming appointments

### Clinic Dashboard
- Shows clinic information
- Lists today's appointments
- Shows recent patients
- Can manage appointments
- Can add medical records
